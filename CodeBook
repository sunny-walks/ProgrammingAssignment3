*Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset*

All transformations of from raw data are described in Readme.MD
Final output is a dataset that presents the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
Each variable is represented by a column, and each activity / subject is represented by a row. 
Therefore, 6 types of activities for 30 people give 180 observations. Variables - 68 columns:

_2 new columns:_
"person_id" - 1..30  - one value for each participant of the experiment 
"activity_type" - 6 levels - WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

_66 columns average of features:_
"tBodyAcc-mean-X"

_Column names decoding:_
t - time measurements
f - frequency domain measurements
Body - body acceleration 
Gravity - gravity acceleration
Acc - measurements from the accelerometer
Gyro - measurements from the gyroscope
Jerk - udden movement acceleration
Mag - magnitude calculated using the Euclidean norm
mean - average
std - standard deviation
X/Y/Z - 3 axes of direction

The units given are gâ€™s for the accelerometer and rad/sec for the gyro and g/sec and rad/sec/sec for the corresponding jerks.
